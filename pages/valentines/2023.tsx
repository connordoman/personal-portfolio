            For real though I love you so much and I&apos;m so glad I met you. You really are my best friend and
            I&apos;m so grateful that I get to do all these different things with you. Your compassion for others is my
            favorite thing about you and thinking about your smile literally fixes everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            I&apos;m shocked every day at how far we&apos;ve come and how easily we got here. I&apos;ve said it a few
            times but our meet-cute really was what I hoped meeting a girl in university would be like. I remember
            staring at the slides but not seeing a thing because I was thinking about how funny you were and the
            importance of those moments. Asking for your number was the best choice I made last year.
        </p>
        <p>I love you Z.</p>
